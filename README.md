# LiteHRNet
Lite-HRNet: A Lightweight High-Resolution Network  
This is an unofficial pytorch implementation of Lite-HRNet: A Lightweight High-Resolution Network  
the code is transformed from the â€˜https://github.com/HRNet/Lite-HRNet'  

According to the repository 'https://github.com/wuwusky/lite_hrnet', they eliminate some dependencies such as mmcv, mmdet. However, LiteHRNet from this repository is different from the original one, including batchnorm and activation in class ConvModule. For that reason, just a bit modification, LiteHRNet is the same with original now!
